                Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live
                on the internet. My interest in web development started back in
                2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns
                out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot
                about HTML & CSS!
            </p>

            <p>
                Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at
                an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
                student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
                accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
                Upstatement for a variety of clients.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also recently launched a course that covers everything you
                need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.
